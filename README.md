# SHA256ALU

This project is a test project for OpenLane2 by Efabless. We keep the configuration file simple as possible. This project runs in a different container method called nix-terminal. We used WSL and some tweaks to run it. 
We can't find the PDK_ROOT or OPENLANE_ROOT but we dont need it. We use command "openlane --pdk sky130A ~/my_designs/sha256_project/config.json" for running the project. --pdk sky130A is enough for PDK root. Also we need other files for run project. Special thanks to @secworks for beuatiful SHA-256 algorhytm. It can be found at "https://github.com/secworks/sha256/tree/master"

Also special thanks to our teacher Sezen B. for inspiration. All the team has lesser hair then beginning of this project (Feels cool and cozy :) )
